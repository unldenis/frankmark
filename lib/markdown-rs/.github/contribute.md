This article explains how to contribute.
Please read through the following guidelines.

## Contributions

There are several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
See [Support][] if you have questions.

### Financial support

You can help financially.
See [Sponsor][] for more info.

### Improve docs

As a user youâ€™re perfect to help improve the docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, arenâ€™t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome too.
Itâ€™s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.
See [Project][] for more info.

## Submitting an issue

* the issue tracker is for issues, discussions are for questions
* search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
  issue
* ensure youâ€™re using the latest versions of packages and other tools
* use a clear and descriptive title
* include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
  error message, version, operating system, etcetera
* the more time you put into an issue, the better help you can get
* the best issue report is a failing test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

* run `cargo fmt` and `cargo test` locally to format and test your changes
* non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
  you from doing unnecessary work
* for ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
  community for feedback as soon as possible
* new features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
* donâ€™t include unrelated changes
* write a convincing description of why your pull request should land:
  itâ€™s your job to be convincing

## Project (for maintainers)

See [Project][project] in the readme for info on how the project is structured
and how to run useful scripts.

### Release

* update the `version` field in `Cargo.toml`
* search for the previous version in `readme.md`, replace with new one
* `git commit --all --message 1.2.3 && git tag 1.2.3 && git push && git push --tags`
* `cargo publish`

(similar for `mdast_util_to_markdown`)
